# Designing-Artificial-Muscles
Soft active artificial muscle has brought a great
attention for soft robotics research. There is a need for designing
smart miniaturized soft actuators that can be operated in
confined environment likely the surgical applications. One of
these smart soft materials are the artificial muscles, there are
different approaches for designing artificial muscles that can
be operated at low voltages and current. In this research, an
electro-chemo-mechanical actuators has been implemented, the
actuator is a trilayer structure where the upper and lower
layers are conductive layer and the double layer capacitance is
dielectric, the actuator is working in air-configuration mode
where the electric potential field applied to it ends. The
material used for fabrication the actuator is PEDOT/NBR-
PEO/PEDOT. The principle of the actuation is based on the
principle of the electro-static interaction among the mobile ions
and the elementary electric charges. However, there isnot a
clear explanation how the actuator produce a force given a
specific geometry. This interesting question is inspired from
the mother nature where the chameleon tongue for instance
can change the shape of their tongue and still maintain the
required force to catch its prey. In this research, a stress-charge
coupling model has been proposed based on the coloumbâ€™s
inverse law to correlate the relationship between the applied
potential field with the generated force along the spatial domain
of the actuator given a desired geometry. The advantage of the
proposed model is the capability of predicting the steady state
force generated with a given geometry besides its curvature. For
estimating the diffusion of the electric charges, one dimensional
explicit diffusion model is implemented and the stress-charge
coupling then can predict the bending stress of the actuator.
This model can be for estimating the required potential field
for actuating coupled actuators through adding addition stress.
The proposed coupling is time independent as the changes in
the geometry relative to the original ones is not significant, the
computation is cheap and has the same diffusion time as the
lab experiment. For proof of concept, an open loop control of
the Tripod robot is designed for validating the proposed model,
the forward and inverse simulations have been implemented in
SOFA framework, the results shows that the proposed model
and numerical simulations can be used for designing shape
changing electro-chemo-mechanical actuators.
